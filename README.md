# Capstone-project-SQL

In this SQL minor project, I have worked on a simple Student Database Management System. 
The project aims to provide with practical experience in writing SQL queries using various SQL clauses, nested queries, functions, and wildcards.
The project assumes basic knowledge of SQL fundamentals.
